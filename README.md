# Rust Meta Repo

create a new rust project with;

    cargo new name

run a rust project with;

    cargo run
    OR
    rustc name && ./name

cargo build with;

    cargo build --release

build .rs with;

    rustc <filename>

cargo only works on rust projects whilst the Rustc method works for compiling and running individual rust files
